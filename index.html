            <p>Basically, for the past few weeks, I have learnt about <b><i>HTML and CSS</i></b>.</p>
            <p>I undersatnd that Html stands for <b><i>Hypertext Markup Language</i></b>. It is used to create web pages and it is also the structure of the webpage.The basic building blocks are <b><i>tags,attributes and elements</i></b>.</p>
            <The><b><i>Tags</i></b> surround the content and each tag performs a specific function. Examples include: <i>P tag, div tag, b tag, img tag, table tag e.t.c.</i> Tags are enclosed in 'arrow heads'. Most tags have a start and close tag but some are self closing like the img tag. <b><i>Attributes</i></b> give more information about a specific tag e.g the img tag has <i><b>''src</b></i> atrribute, which states the source of the image from the file or a link from the internet and the <i><b>'alt'</b></i> attribute, which describes the image incase the image is broken for the user to have an idea what the image is. <i><b>Element</b></i> includes the start tag, content and the end tag.The Html skeletion starts with <b><i>DOCTYPE Html</i></b> that lets the browser know the type of html. It consists of the head and body parts embedded in the html start and end tag. The body part <b><i>contains all the things that we see on the webpage</i></b> and it where we put all the elements of html. Also, the <i>inline CSS</i> can be put in the body part of the skeleton. The head part contains the title that shows as the title of the document on the browser,<i>the link to external css or internal css</i>.</p>
            <p>CSS stands for <b><i>Cascading Style Sheet</i></b>. It is used for designing the web page alonside with Html. CSS could be <b><i>external</i></b>(has a separate file in the same folder but linked to the html file using <b><i><link rel="stylesheet" href="" class="css"></i></b> which is placed in the head tag of the html),<b><i>internal</i></b>(uses the <b><i>style tag</i></b> embedded in the head of the html file) or <b><i>inline style</i></b>, which is written <b><i>within the body</i></b> of the html file. There are different selectors used in CSS like the <b><i>universal, element, Id, class and attribute</i></b>selectors. These selectors makes it easy to design the html as they implement the design to different parts of the file as one likes. Although there are CSS properties that make one selector or design format overide the other but they all work together to give a good look to the webpage. The color, font size,font style, text decoration, margins and other properties can be styled. </p>

            <!-- <h2>Thrid Section</h2> -->
            <p>Paddings, borders, margins are part of the <b><i>CSS box model</i></b> that surrounds the content. From inside the Box Model out, padding is <b><i>the space between the content and the border</i></b>. The border is the <b><i>line that is the between the padding and the margin</i></b> and could be styled in different ways with border color, width , style and radius. Border color specifies the color of the border, the width specifies the size of the border and the style specifies the design of the line e.g solid, dashed, dotted e.t.c. The border radius is the property that gives rounded edges to the border.The margin is the <b><i>space outside the border</i></b>. The margin and padding could be styled top, bottom, left and right. Alternatively, margin and padding could be styled with equal spacing on all sides with one value.</p>
